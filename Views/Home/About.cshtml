The patients have to maintain their medical profiles and history on paper with the prescriptions provided to them by the doctors or medical staff.  And the hospital/clinic management doesn’t have the record of the patient. Every time a patient re-visits the clinic, the doctor asks for the previous prescriptions to refer to the patient’s history.";
